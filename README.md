**INTRODUCTION**

This project is based on the exploratory data analysis of Historic Olympic Game data using PYTHON.
This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
The aim of this analysis was to extract valuable insights and answer a variety of questions related to the history, participation, and performance of nations and athletes in the Olympic Games.
I have extracted one csv file ‘athlete_events’ using PANDAS, aggregated the data by using NUMPY and generated valuable insights from powerful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
